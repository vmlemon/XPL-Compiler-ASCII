IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO COPY          ONE FILE TO ANOTHER OR TO COPY A CARD DECK TO DISK OR TAPE.                                                                                                         THE PROGRAM REQUIRES THREE FILES, AN ALTER FILE, A SOURCE FILE,             AND AN OUTPUT FILE.  THE ALTER FILE CONTAINS CONTROL CARDS INDICATING           THE LOCATION OF CHANGES TO BE MADE, AND ANY CARDS WHICH ARE TO BE               ADDED TO THE SOURCE FILE.  THE SOURCE FILE IS THE PROGRAM TO BE                 UPDATED.  IT MAY BE OMITTED IF A NEW FILE IS BEING MADE FROM CARDS.                                                                                                 THE CHOICE OF DEVICE (TAPE, DISKS, OR CARDS) FOR SOURCE AND                 OUTPUT FILES IS DETERMINED BY JOB CONTROL CARDS.  THE ALTER FILE                HAS THE DDNAME SYSIN, THE SOURCE FILE HAS THE DDNAME INPUT3, AND                THE OUTPUT FILE HAS THE DDNAME OUTPUT3.  SEE THE PROSE FILE ON                  THE DISTRIBUTION TAPE FOR EXAMPLES OF APPROPRIATE JCL.                                                                                                              THE ALTER DECK CONTAINS CONTROL CARDS AND CARDS TO BE ADDED TO              THE SOURCE DECK.  IF A CARD IN THE ALTER FILE CONTAINS $$ IN COLUMNS            1 AND 2 THEN IT IS TAKEN TO BE A CONTROL CARD.  OTHERWISE IT IS ADDED           TO THE SOURCE DECK.  THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF CONTROL CARDS:                                                                                                              $$ L                                                                                                                                                            $$ EOF                                                                                                                                                          $$ <CARD SPECIFICATIONS>                                                                                                                              WHERE <CARD SPECIFICATIONS> WILL BE DESCRIBED SHORTLY.

IF THE           VARIABLE HAS THE VALUE FALSE THEN ONLY CHANGES (ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS)        AND CONTROL CARDS WILL BE LISTED.  IF IT HAS THE VALUE TRUE THEN THE            ENTIRE OUTPUT FILE WILL BE LISTED.  THE VARIABLE IS INITIALLY SET TO            THE VALUE FALSE.                                                                                                                                                    $$ EOF  SIGNIFIES THE END OF THE ALTER INPUT.  THE OUTPUT FILE              IS TERMINATED AT THE POINT WHICH WAS REACHED WHEN THE $$ EOF CARD WAS           DETECTED.  NO FURTHER CARDS ARE READ FROM THE ALTER INPUT FILE OR               FROM THE SOURCE FILE (SYSIN AND INPUT3).  THIS CARD IS CONVENIENT               WHEN CREATING A NEW SOURCE FILE, ALTHOUGH SPECIFYING INPUT3 TO BE               A DUMMY FILE  (//INPUT3 DD DUMMY) WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT.                                                                                                        THE THIRD TYPE OF CONTROL CARD HAS THREE SUB-TYPES.                                                                                                         <CARD SPECIFICATIONS>  ::=  <UNSIGNED INTEGER>                                                           |  <UNSIGNED INTEGER>  ,                                                        |  <UNSIGNED INTEGER>  ,  <UNSIGNED INTEGER>                                                                                           THE <CARD SPECIFICATIONS> IS TERMINATED BY A BLANK.  THE EFFECTS OF             THE THREE TYPES OF CARD SPECIFICATION ARE:                                                                                                                      <UNSIGNED INTEGER>                                                                  THE SOURCE FILE IS COPIED TO THE OUTPUT FILE UP TO AND INCLUDING                THE CARD SPECIFIED BY THE INTEGER.  THEN ANY NON-CONTROL CARDS                  IN THE ALTER DECK UP TO THE NEXT CONTROL CARD ARE ADDED TO THE                  OUTPUT FILE.                                                                                                                                                <UNSIGNED INTEGER>  ,                                                               THE SOURCE FILE IS COPIED TO THE OUTPUT FILE UP TO BUT NOT                      INCLUDING THE CARD SPECIFIED BY THE INTEGER.  THEN ANY CARDS IN THE             ALTER DECK UP TO THE NEXT CONTROL CARD ARE ADDED TO THE OUTPUT                  FILE.  THE CARD SPECIFIED BY THE INTEGER IS DELETED.                                                                                                        <UNSIGNED INTEGER>  ,  <UNSIGNED INTEGER>                                           THE SOURCE FILE IS COPIED TO THE OUTPUT FILE UP TO BUT NOT INCLUDING            THE CARD SPECIFIED BY THE FIRST INTEGER.  THE CARDS IN THE SOURCE               FILE IN THE RANGE INDICATED BY THE PAIR OF INTEGERS INCLUSIVE                   ARE DELETED.  ANY CARDS IN THE ALTER DECK UP TO THE NEXT CONTROL                CARD ARE COPIED TO THE OUTPUT FILE.                                                                                                                             ALTERATIONS MUST BE MADE IN NUMERICALLY ASCENDING SEQUENCE.  ANY            REFERENCE TO A LINE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN READ FROM THE SOURCE FILE WILL       CAUSE AN ERROR MESSAGE.                                                                                                                                             THE <CARD SPECIFICATIONS> MAY BE OPTIONALLY FOLLOWED BY A CHARACTER         STRING.  THIS STRING IS USED TO CHECK THE LINE NUMBER INDICATED IN THE          CARD SPECIFICATION AGAINST THE ACTUAL CARD IN THE SOURCE FILE.                  THE FIRST NON-BLANK CHARACTER OF THE ALTER CARD IS MATCHED WITH THE             FIRST NON-BLANK CHARACTER OF THE LAST NON-DELETED CARD FROM THE SOURCE          FILE.  A CHARACTER BY CHARACTER COMPARISON IS DONE THROUGH THE LAST             NON-BLANK CHARACTER ON THE ALTER CONTROL CARD.  IF ANY MISMATCH IS              FOUND AND ERROR MESSAGE IS GIVEN AND THE INDICATED ALTERATION                   IS NOT PERFORMED.  THE ALTER DESK IS SEARCHED FOR THE NEXT CONTROL CARD.                                                                                            NUMBERING OF THE SOURCE FILE STARTS FROM ONE WITH A CONSTANT                INCREMENT OF ONE.  IF THE FIRST CARDS IN THE ALTER CONTROL DECK ARE NOT         ALTER CONTROL CARDS THEN THEY WILL BE INSERTED BEFORE THE FIRST CARD OF         THE SOURCE FILE.
